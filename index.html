          <h2>Galdessa Camp Overview </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Nestling under the doum palms in an isolated corner of Tsavo East National Park, the area is excellent for elephants and lions and has spectacular birdlife. Formerly owned by the exuberant owners of <b> Alfajiri Villas at Diani</b>, the lodge was sold in 2017 to the <b>Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</b>, You arrive into the welcome shade of the main dining and lounge area – a spacious, open-sided, high-roofed structure with glorious views across the river, all the furniture is custom-made, with heavy, varnished logs of dead wood salvaged from the park and stylish, cream cushion covers. <b>Galdessa Camp</b> is unfenced and visited constantly by large heads of elephants and hippos. Consequently, all your movements around <b>Galdessa Camp Day</b> and night are escorted, by the coolly white-uniformed, red-sashed stewards and waiting staff, Private Galdessa, have their own private stewards, for the course of their stay). The bandas at<b> Galdessa Camp</b> forming the main part of the camp are ranged upstream along the south bank of the Galana river from Banda 1 close to the central area of the camp to banda 5, about 300m away, The bandas are built on raised platforms of dark polished boards, Soaring makuti roofs protect an open-sided partly permanent structure with walls of cream-coloured tent canvas and green mosquito screen. The front of these opens completely with the canvas zipping away to the sides, really an airy and comfortable cottage – that is hard to get right, but Galdessa has cracked it. The style of furniture in the main areas of camp is continued in the bandas, with fun, but very heavy, armchairs and bed frames, constructed from dead wood trunks and branches, and padded with big cushions. As the bandas aren’t mosquito-proof, all the beds have frame-hanging mosquito nets. Banda 7 is a honeymoon suite. Sundowners and short walks around Lugards’ Falls, bush breakfasts and early and late game drives are the main activities on offer at <b>Galdessa camp</b>. You can also do more strenuous bush walks – not a bad idea in order to work off the calories accumulated with each new encounter with <b>Galdessa Lodge</b> kitchen. The walks, for which Galdessa has negotiated special permission from KWS, set off from Galdessa itself, accompanied by armed KWS rangers. Galdessa Camp is in a part of the Tsavo Park that despite its accessibility is relatively isolated, as it is not on one of the handful of main arterial earth roads across the park. In fact, the river road south from Galdessa first crosses an excitingly rocky lugga (seasonal river course) that deters most vehicles not based at the <b>Galdesa camp</b> from attempting it, there is plenty of very enjoyable game-viewing and poking around to be done quite close to Galdessa, where it’s rare to run into any vehicles except the odd one from Galdessa itself. You will regularly see the classically red-coloured elephants of the region wading across the river, often accompanied by snorts of annoyance from dozing hippos, and you will also be treated to close encounters with lions, just minutes from Galdessa camp, Black rhinos are carefully monitored by KWS rangers, with all this wildlife around, the noises of the night and the dawn chorus are astonishing.

          <h2>Galdessa Camp History </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Back in 1992 Anthony Russell found this heavenly spot on the Galana River, deep in Tsavo East, a park of over 11,000 square kilometers of pure wilderness. Anthony Russell was the first person to win a Kenya Wildlife Service long-term lease in Tsavo East. Anthony coined Galdessa the name, which is in the local Waliangulu dialect the tribal name for Baboon as there are many baboons in this location of Tsavo East. Before construction commenced, we had to clear the area of them after which, and Anthony named it in their honor. Galdessa Camp is set on a large bend in the river deep in Tsavo East which gives it constant breeze, the tentage is set under a clustered of doum palm trees. The original designs on the first house have been incorporated into the overall design of Galdessa Camp. Today it is just the same, set in time and great wild life: elephants, lion and huge herds of buffalo, leopard and cheetah. Today Galdessa’s management, services and food are first class. In 1993 we reintroduced black rhino to this area of Tsavo East with KWS. The project started with four rhinos from Nairobi National Park. KWS planned an ambitious free release system and over the next six years we ended up with sixty-four black rhinos successfully released. Today they can also be spotted in the vicinity of Galdessa. Tsavo East remains a great wilderness and Galdessa a gem in this milestone. The site is located 15 kilometers upstream from Lugards Falls, famous for its beautiful rock formations, where there is also an airstrip, which can be used for private aircraft transfers. <b>Galdessa Camp</b> remote access in a very wild part of the Tsavo Park ensures that tourism is kept to a minimum, enhancing the intimacy the camp, and guests, enjoy with nature. The accommodation and activities are geared at the discerning traveler looking for a private experience in the African bush. Tsavo is still very much pristine and you will live your experience without the inconvenience of mass tourism, which does not come to this remote yet magical part of the park. Wildlife regularly use the campgrounds, especially elephants at least 8,000 in number, constitute Kenya’s largest population, a daily sign that the Camp and Friends of Tsavo Organization have succeeded in minimizing the impact on the environment. The camp is located in the heart of one of Africa’s most successful conservation projects, and is lucky to have 48 black rhinos in its direct vicinity. Under the shade of the Doum palms, the camp’s 5 spacious “bandas” are comfortable, fresh, and elegant. Set well apart, they all face the river and the Yatta Plateau, the world’s largest fossilized lava flow (over 200 kilometers long). The term “banda” is an African word describing a bungalow-like structure enhanced by the best attributes a true-tented camp accommodation has to offer. Two of Galdessa’s bandas are organized in suites, with their own, separate thatched sitting room where private meals may also be served. The most remote banda is ideal for honeymooners in search of privacy, with its own sitting room, viewing platform and water wallow. The Galdessa room is set under a thatch structure for coolness and comfort, with a spacious en-suite bathroom/dressing room. Perfectly adapted to the environment, it is a refined expression of the safaris of yesteryear. The walls are made of canvas and mosquito netting tastefully set in timber frames. The natural woods, thatched roofs, stone tables and mosquito netting form a romantic interior which enhances the contact with the rhythms and sounds of the natural world outside. To underscore their commitment to eco-tourism leadership in Kenya, <b>Galdessa Camp Tsavo Park</b> uses solar power and recycles their waste, and has even installed a water treatment plant. The waterside location translates into activities in addition to game drives, most notably guided walks by the river and bush breakfasts, and whatever you do there will be no crowds. Tsavo East is huge in size and you could easily spend a morning looking at the wildlife – the chances of seeing lions is high and leopards are not rare — without ever coming across another vehicle. At Galdessa Camp Tsavo itself you may well see elephants at very close quarters as young ones like to follow the bank of the river to eat the fruit of the Rousseauesque doum trees. An escarpment prevents animals from entering the camp grounds from the river but your luxury, en-suite tent is close to the water so you may unzip and look out in the morning to find a baby elephant chomping away at a distance of a few metres.

          <h2>Galdessa Camp How to get there </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Galdessa Camp is located in Tsavo East National Park, from Nairobi it takes roughly five hours through the Nairobi-Mombasa highway and from Mombasa it takes roughly four hours to the Galdessa Camp depending on the traffic. One can also get to the camp by air with the flight taking approximately 40 minutes from Mombasa and 1 hour from Nairobi to Manyani Airstrip where you will be picked to the Galdessa Camp for an estimate of 30 minutes’ drive. The camp is located on the southern bank of Galana River. which ensures spotting of wild animals before or after your game drive since the animals visit the Galana River to cool down themselves and drinking water. This makes you start your safari while relaxing in the camp and thus makes you eager to explore more in the Tsavo East National Park. Galdessa camp has a main camp and a private camp. The main camp has more than 12 luxurious, semi tented and spacious bungalows with a private veranda. Between each bungalow there is privacy and each bungalow has an en suite bathroom. There are a dining room and restaurant where guests can enjoy their meals while viewing the beauty of savannah and wild animals who frequently visit the Galana River. The private camp consists of 3 luxurious semi tented bungalows with en suite bathrooms and has its dining room. The weather is hot and dry but since the camp is at the bank of Galana River you will enjoy a cool breeze while enjoying the amazing views of volcanic features such as the yatta plateau, the world’s longest and oldest fossilized lava flow. Animals such as the hippos and elephants and a variety of different birds’ species do visit the galena river. Galdessa Camp's location means it is blessed by many things, from its views of the Yatta Plateau, to the Galanda river rolling past its doorstep, but little surpasses the wildlife living all around. Elephants are frequently in the area and some of them have learned that Galdessa Camp is ripe with doum palm fruits, which they love. Ed, as he's been affectionately called by camp staff, is a character who loves to pop by and enjoy nature's offerings whenever he's in the area. You can find out more about the two Galdessa camps, which generate funds for conservation projects in Tsavo, at Galdessa Camp isn't only a stunning lodge generating funds for conservation that sits on the banks of the Galana River, in Kenya's largest National Park, Tsavo East: It is also a popular haunt for visiting wildlife and one of our most regular guests is Ed - as our lodge staff chose to name him - a young bull elephant. Ed visits at different times throughout the year and while he is always happy to munch on the grasses, his favourite treat is the doum palm nuts, which fall from the palms surrounding the lodge. Given his love of these, our staff collect the doum nuts from the lawns, so that when he visits - or any of his friends, as we have a few regular elephant visitors - we can always toss him a few of his favourite things to munch on.

              <h2>Tsavo East Safaris</h2>
              <p style="text-align:justify; font: weight 6px;">
                The southern part of Tsavo East National Park is a popular destination for short Tsavo East National Park safaris by minibus from the coast. Most of these trips take clients up to Voi, where they stay in one of the Tsavo East lodges, most of which are located only a few minutes’ drive from the highway. None of Tsavo East’s airstrips are currently used by scheduled flights. While chartering an exclusive flight for your trip (usually from Nairobi) is an option, chartering can be expensive for small parties or couples. We therefore offer high-quality road transfers, in fully equipped 4x4 safari vehicles, for Expert Africa travellers doing Tsavo East safari add-ons in. These include full board stays, with all activities, at two of the park’s best safari camps.</p>

              <h2>Getting to Tsavo East National Park</h2>
              <p style="text-align:justify; font: weight 6px;">
                It takes between 5 to 7 hrs to get to Tsavo west national park by road from Nairobi. The park has four gates and they are Manyani Gate, Voi Gate, Buchuma Gate, and Sala Gate. Roads in the reserve are fairly good and can be traversed by 2-wheel drive vehicles although they can be a challenge in the wet season and 4-wheel drive vehicles will do better. It is also possible to get to the park using chartered flights (no scheduled flights) and there are over 19 airstrips that can be used.
