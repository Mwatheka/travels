                    <h2>Tsavo East Safaris</h2>
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                      The southern part of Tsavo East National Park is a popular destination for short Tsavo East National Park safaris by minibus from the coast. Most of these trips take clients up to Voi, where they stay in one of the Tsavo East lodges, most of which are located only a few minutes’ drive from the highway. None of Tsavo East’s airstrips are currently used by scheduled flights. While chartering an exclusive flight for your trip (usually from Nairobi) is an option, chartering can be expensive for small parties or couples. We therefore offer high-quality road transfers, in fully equipped 4x4 safari vehicles, for Expert Africa travellers doing Tsavo East safari add-ons in. These include full board stays, with all activities, at two of the park’s best safari camps.

                  <h2>Galdessa Main Camp Accommodation</h2>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">
                    <b>Galdessa Camp</b> offers a luxurious and once in a lifetime opportunity for travelers seeking to immerse themselves in a hidden and untouched corner of Tsavo National Park. Enjoying a position on the Galana river, wildlife sightings are frequent, whether guests enjoy a game drive or remain at the camp watching hippos, elephants and more as they come to cool off in the river. Self-catering, fully staffed with trained chef. Galdessa Camp accommodates 10 people across <b>five tents</b>. It can be booked in tandem with Galdessa Little, which sleeps a further 6 people across three tents. The semi-tented bungalows at Galdessa are solid, permanent structures, built on wooden platforms and spaced far enough apart to ensure a good level of privacy. Bathrooms have bucket showers (hot water on demand), and flush toilets. The rooms have a very natural, earthy feel, with furniture constructed from tree trunks and branches found within the park, dark polished wood panel floors, thatch roofing, and walls that are part canvas, part stone-and-mortar. They open onto private viewing decks. There's a large honeymoon suite at Galdessa's private bush camp. Tasty bush breakfasts are provided during morning game activities, while delicious Italian cuisine is served for lunch and dinner. The menus at Galdessa are fixed, but the staff are generally very flexible. As always, it's best to let us know in advance of your dietary requirements. There are no age restrictions at <b>Galdessa Main Camp</b>, though it's not ideal for younger children. The camp doesn't offer any special facilities for youngsters. It's also entirely unfenced, meaning children will need to be under constant supervision. <b>Galdessa Main Camp</b> is closely involved with a black rhino re-introduction project that aims to create a sustainable environment for these endangered creatures in Tsavo. So far, the project has been a success, with as many as 50 rhinos now in living Tsavo, giving the park one of the largest populations in Africa.
